                        During the last few months of being abused by a narcissist my physical health
                        began to degrade significantly.  Fitness and nutrition play a major role in my 
                        self-care practice and I didn't have any energy left to take care of myself.
                        Now that I am in Seattle and free from that situationship I am once again tracking 
                        my macros, hitting the gym, making movement a priority, and on a journey of 
                        self-discovery and healing the likes of which I never thought possible for me.
                        Stick around.  What happens next is going to be absolutely amazing.

                            Another major part of my self-love journey is <a class="link" href="https://www.mojampresents.com/">
                            <font color="#A2AABO">MoJam Monday</font></a>.  This is an improvised
                            jam session where random musicians make up jazzy, funky, and sometimes rock songs on 
                            the spot.  My goal as an improvised vocalist is to come up with lyrics and tell a story
                            from my heart.  I've gotta tell you, this is one of the most freeing and incredible
                            feelings in the entire world.  You have to put your ego aside, tap into the most raw 
                            parts of who you are, and send it out into the world without hesitation.  It is an 
                            absolutely life changing experience for me.  The truest freedom I have ever experienced...
                            and trust me when I tell you I've chased a lot of dragons and hunted a lot of shadows
                            in the pursuit prior to finding myself here.  <a class="link" href="https://www.tonipoe.com/">

                            I have been writing poetry as a means of processing difficult emotions for at least 
                            5 years.  I've called myself a poet for that long at least...but it wasn't until I 
                            walked out of my life in Germany to escape abuse and landed in Seattle on 21 Jan 23
                            that I truly came to life as a poet.  Open mics, a creative community surrounding and 
                            supporting me, and the upcoming release of my book
